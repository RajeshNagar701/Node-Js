OOPS

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP provide securities 
OOP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
Example :

Class ===   Fruits / car
Object  ====  apple,banana,orange / volve audi ford

oops Features : 

Class 
Object
Encapsulation
Inheritance / Reusability    == extends 
Access Modifier / Visibility  public private protected  
Polymorphism / overloading / overriding

In JavaScript, classes are the special type of functions. 
We can define the class just like function declarations and function expressions.

The JavaScript class contains various class members within a body including 
methods or constructor. The class is executed in strict mode. So, the code containing the silent error or mistake throws an error.

The class syntax contains two components:

Class declarations
Class expressions

<script>
class abc
{
	demo() 
	{
		document.write('hello');
	}
	simple()
	{
		var a=10;
		var b=20;
		var sum;
		sum=a+b;
		document.write(sum);
	}
}
const obj= new abc();
obj.demo();
obj.simple();
</script>
